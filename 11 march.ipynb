    "Suppose a medical test is designed to detect a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. The test has a 95% accuracy rate, meaning it correctly identifies 95% of people who have the disease and 95% of people who do not have the disease. If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

    "- P(A) = 0.01 (prior probability of having the disease)\n",

    "- P(B) = P(B|A) x P(A) + P(B|not A) x P(not A) = 0.95 x 0.01 + 0.05 x 0.99 = 0.059\n",

    "Therefore, the probability of actually having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.1%. This means that even if a person tests positive for the disease, there is still an 83.9% chance that they do not have the disease, due to the low prior probability of having the disease and the imperfect accuracy of the test.\n",

    "Bayes's theorem can be a useful tool in many areas, such as medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and risk analysis, where we need to update our beliefs or probabilities based on new information."

The null hypothesis would be that the new medication does not have a significant effect, and the alternative hypothesis would be that it does.
